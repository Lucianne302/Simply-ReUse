                    <p class="card-text">
                        In August, California became the first state in the U.S. to require any company making plastic bottles to use recycled plastic. 
                        Governor Newsom signed AB 793 into law on September 24th. Starting in 2022, big changes are coming to plastic bottles in the products available 
                        to consumers. Many food and beverage manufacturers use virgin plastic to make their bottles. It’s what they’re used to and believe it’s stronger. 
                        Recycled plastic loses some of its strength. As a result, many companies do not buy and incorporate recycled plastic into their products. 
                        This is concerning as consumer plastics that are recycled aren’t being used in products that consumers purchase regularly.</p>

                        Take a trip back to the 1980s when recycling started gaining steam. School kids were informed to put their unneeded papers into boxes in the classroom. 
                        Those papers would get recycled. Bottles and glass became the next items being recycled. At the time, the focus was on keeping reusable materials out of 
                        overflowing landfills. Fast forward several decades. Recycling is now becoming a new problem because it’s costing cities more to recycle than they’re 
                        getting back in fees and sales of reusable materials. In Dayton, Ohio, authorities are taking an extreme measure to educate the public about recycling..</p>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        The recycling industry has seen so many changes over the decades. As early as the late-1800s, men were going from one home to the next 
                        looking for worn-out clothing. Why? Companies bought the “rags” to turn them into paper and hired men to collect those rags. This was just 
                        the beginning. Every decade, recycling advances. Where will it be 10, 20, or 30 years from now?

                        Everyone should recycle as much as they can both at home and the office. Landfills are overflowing across 
                        the nation and each day more trash is generated. The Global E-Waste Statistics Partnership estimates that 
                        each US resident generates around 42 pounds of e-waste each year. Only 25 states have laws that mandate 
                        electronics recycling. Only 19 states ban the disposal of e-waste 
                        in a landfill. It’s not enough, and people need to take steps to make sure they’re recycling e-waste.

                        In the beginning of 2019, Trader Joe’s, an American chain of grocery stores, announced plans 
                        to eliminate more than 1 million pounds of plastic from their 488 stores. Since that time, 
                        they have “identified and are in the process of implementing packaging changes that will remove a total 
                        of nearly 4 million pounds of plastic” from their products every year.

                        The first will give you $10 towards a new pair of jeans at American Eagle. Not only will they give you 
                        $10 off a pair of brand-new AE jeans just for bringing in your old jeans (any brand), they’ll recycle 
                        those jeans and plant a tree (up to 25,000 trees) to help with the wildfire devastation in California. 
                        Win for you and win-win for the planet. The second doesn’t even involve leaving your house. If you don’t 
                        need a new pair of jeans but want to rid yourself of your old pairs and help the planet while you’re at it, 
                        Zappos for Good lets you mail in your denim for free. Just box it up, print the shipping label and send it away.

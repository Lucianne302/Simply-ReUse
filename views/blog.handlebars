                    <p class="card-text">In August, California became the first state in the U.S. to require any company making plastic bottles to use recycled plastic. 
                    Governor Newsom signed AB 793 into law on September 24th. Starting in 2022, big changes are coming to plastic bottles in the products available 
                    to consumers. Many food and beverage manufacturers use virgin plastic to make their bottles. It’s what they’re used to and believe it’s stronger. 
                    Recycled plastic loses some of its strength. As a result, many companies do not buy and incorporate recycled plastic into their products. 
                    This is concerning as consumer plastics that are recycled aren’t being used in products that consumers purchase regularly.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The recycling industry has seen so many changes over the decades. As early as the late-1800s, men were going 
                    from one home to the next looking for worn-out clothing. Why? Companies bought the “rags” to turn them into paper and hired men to collect those rags. 
                    This was just the beginning. Every decade, recycling advances. Where will it be 10, 20, or 30 years from now</p>

                    <p class="card-text">We’re all recycling as much as possible. We’re also generating trash every day. Per the EPA, 
                                         Americans compost and recycle over 1.5 pounds of materials each day and trash almost 4.5 pounds of materials per day.
                                         People have made great changes that reduce the stream of waste going into landfills. People are composting food scraps. They’re recycling electronics correctly. They’re reducing the amount of paper they use by getting books, magazines, and newspapers in digital formats.
                                         It’s all great news, but there are still issues.</p>
